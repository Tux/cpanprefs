  Why do some people believe that dieing is the appropariate way to
  proceed whan just a dependency is not fulfilled?

  When it comes to the dialog "Install ..." then it is already too
  late to fix things. (Usually pgk-config not installed)

match:
  distribution: '^TSCH/Cairo-\d'
depends:
  configure_requires:
    ExtUtils::PkgConfig: 0
    ExtUtils::Depends: 0
  requires:
    Test::Number::Delta: 0
pl:
  args:
    - "PREREQ_FATAL=0"
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 10
    talk:
      - "Install ExtUtils::PkgConfig from CPAN"
      - "n\n"
