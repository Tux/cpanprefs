  Added XML::LibXML to satisfy XML::Validator::Schema and maybe others
  later. XML::SAX would accept to be installed without parser, do not
  know why. Update 2008-11-10 got circular dependency between LibXML
  and SAX:-(, had to remove that again, trying with single requires
  (instead of configure_requires) now. Update 2008-11-12 no, not
  working wiht "requires" either, it's a real circular dependency to
  specify XML::LibXML here.

  Introduced eexpect after seeing that the question is not asked when
  we are called very early, like on 20081105T0337

match:
  distribution: '^GRANTM/XML-SAX-\d'
pl: 
  eexpect:
    mode: anyorder
    timeout: 10
    reuse: 0
    talk:
      - "Do you want XML::SAX to alter ParserDetails.ini"
      - "y\n"
